        <h1>Overview: E-Commerce React Development</h1>
        <p> This development project sought out to utilize my React skills to create a simple User Interface that emulates
            many online popular retail sites today. I started by conducting research across various existing retail UIs 
            and drawing inspiration from my findings to create an optimized design for a second-hand clothes retail platform. This prototype contains a list with
            filtering and sorting features along with a shopping cart aggregator. 
        </p>

        <p> I was inspired by recent movements for sustainable online retail, such as <a href="https://www.trashie.io/new-home">Trashie</a>, and 
            chose to focus my research on online clothing retail platforms.</p>

        <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
        <p> To get a basis of how other organizations are designing their interfaces, I performed a competitive analysis comparing
            differing list and aggregator features from some of the top fast-fashion retailers. The following sites were selected for the study:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://us.shein.com/?url_from=usgooglebrandshein_sheinshein_srsa_20210930&cid=370313608&setid=25652838688&adid=549022341969&pf=GOOGLE&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw_LOwBhBFEiwAmSEQARegFpqaRknuQC8uptcpHKhGd2X-8MbiSGO8AUlzTrr6KYr47gcyERoCo0wQAvD_BwE">
            Shein</a></strong> - Shein is a Chinese-Singaporean fast fashion retailer. Founded in Nanjing, China, Shein grew to become the world's largest fashion retailer as of 2022.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.temu.com/">Temu</a></strong> - Temu is a Chinese-based online marketplace that offers heavily discounted consumer goods which are mostly shipped to consumers directly from China.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.wish.com/feed/reach-cids-000000000000000000000000-from_ad-19808826207?filter=reach-cids-000000000000000000000000-from_ad-19808826207&utm_source=ggl&utm_medium=pmax&utm_campaign=19808826207&from_ad=19808826207&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw_LOwBhBFEiwAmSEQAYW56onIhzfJ1L_1AZWpdqLHLJMyF5WMuAyoWKWXD7F3i4KDzTR2WhoC7vUQAvD_BwE&hide_login_modal=true">
            Wish</a></strong> - Wish is an American online e-commerce platform for transactions between sellers and buyers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> I observed the different features offered by each site and created a competitive comparison chart to visualize the differences
            between each retailer. The chart can be found below.
        </p>

        <h2>Comparison Summary</h2>

        <p> 
            The three websites selected all served similar purposes for users; providing an e-commerce platform for fast fashion purchases. 
            Nonetheless, they all offered different favoriting, sorting, and aggregator features. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            All of the sites had some kind of filtering 
            option; however, Shein and Wish were the only ones that offered filtering by clothing article type (ex: tops). Considering these 
            sites are often used in search of affordable clothing alternatives, I was surprised to see only Shein had a price filtering feature. 
            In terms of aggregator features, Shein was the only website that offered “1 Click Buy” features, but it was only for certain products.
            This feature seemed a bit unnecessary since most users purchase more than one item at a time, it did not fully align with the user's mental
            process.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike the other two sides, Wish did not offer a Quick add feature for the cart nor did it include a cart pop up, in order to add an item 
            to the cart a user must click on the item link and add it in a new window. This felt like very weak decision to me as it seemed to disrupt
            the heirarchy of the site forcing users to switch between the cart and item list pages as they shop. All three carts did, however, include a quantity increment feature 
            for each item to change the number of each item being purchased/remove them from the cart. Overall, I felt Shein’s design provided features that 
            complemented the users' intentions on the site, such as the price filter and cart quick add; however, some features felt seamingly
            felt unnecessary. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="part-2">
        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>
            In the spirit of pushing for more sustainable online retail practices, I chose to focus on creating a second-hand 
            clothing shopping experience for users called "Eco-Fashion". The site is meant to offer users with retail services for
            second-hand clothing items. Below I listed some of the major features I chose to incorporate, many of
            which were inspired by my competitive research analysis. 
        </p>

        <h2>Sorting/Aggregator Features:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clothing Article Filtering</strong> - Users can filter list results by clothing type</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Price Filtering</strong> - Items can be filtered according to a maximum price slider</li>
            <li><strong>Price Sorting</strong> - Items list can be sorted by price from cheapest to most expensive</li>
            <li><strong>Cart Pop-Up</strong> - A user's shopping cart is displayed adjacent to the clothing items as they shop</li>
            <li><strong>Cart Quick-Add Button</strong> - Users can add an item to their card with the press of a button without having to switch windows/screens</li>
            <li><strong>Remove Item/Clear Cart Button</strong> - Users can remove a single type of item from a cart or clear their cart completely as they shop</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lofi Wireframe</h2>

        <p>
            Before starting development I decided to create a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/pVeVTdgRlPiCEHQc4Hphx7/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=840UKlptf3a4Ivub-1">lofi wireframe on figma</a> to get a better sense of the structure I wanted
            for my webpage. I chose to place the clothing items in the center to draw the users' attention to them. Each clothing item
            card contains its name, its article/categorical type, price, and a cart quick-add button. Just to the side on the left, 
            users have access to the sorting and filter tools so they can keep track of these settings as they shop. Finally, I placed
            the shopping cart pop-up on the right as it is likely the final section of the page users will navigate to. 
        </p>
        
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/pVeVTdgRlPiCEHQc4Hphx7/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=840UKlptf3a4Ivub-1">
            <img src="assets/figma-lofi.png"></img>
        </a>
        
    </div>

    <div class="part-3">
        <h1>Final Product and Deployment</h1>
        <p>Having collected the necessary data and created a rough design of my <a href="https://development-project-ten.vercel.app/">site</a>, I began the development process. The site was built in ReactJS using CSS for styling and 
            deployed on Vercel. 
        </p>
        
        <a href="https://development-project-ten.vercel.app/">
        <img src="assets/final-site.png"></img>
        </a>

        <h2> Design Choices and Summary</h2>

        <p> In the theme of sustainability, I opted for greens and natural oranges for the color scheme, making sure 
            to create enough contrast to ensure accessibility. Using adequate font sizes and consistent font styles throughout
            the webpage, I maintained an organized and navigable hierarchy. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I incorporated all of the features mentioned before into the final design. The categorical filtering and price sorting
            tools are bubbles that turn orange when selected to keep track of filter selections, emulating a check-list of sorts. The 
            price filtering tool is a slider for optimal precision and intuitiveness for users. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            I noticed that although some of the websites I researched had quick-add buttons for clothing items, none of them had 
            quick-remove buttons. As users shop it is common for them to find alternative items or lose interest in items that already 
            are included in their carts. So, for items already added to the cart, I decided to add a "Remove" button, so users can choose to 
            remove them from their cart as needed. I also added an "Empty Cart" button that removes all items from the cart. Similarly,
            I added a "Reset" button to reset all of the filtering/sorting settings without disrupting the users' cart. 
        </p>

        <h2>Shortcomings</h2>

        <p>Overall, the webpage contains all of the minimal requirements for basic prototype functionality; however, there 
            were a couple of features I felt could have been enhanced or added. I think it would have made more sense instead of
            having a maximum price slider to incorporate a price range slider that handled minimum and maximimum price values. Additionally,
            for the remove/add from cart feature, I think it would have been more realistic to add a quantity attribute to the cart where
            users could input the quantity of each item they wanted to purchase. With more time, these features could have been implemented and 
            enhanced the prototype's quality.
